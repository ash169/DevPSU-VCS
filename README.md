# DEV​PSU - SP2020

## Terminal & Version Control

This project has two sub-projects, the first is on using the terminal and the second is Git. By the end of the project you will have your first ever github repository with any personal project you've made in the past.

## Terminal Sub-Project

To get the hang of using the Terminal complete the following steps using any terminal on you computer:

● Navigate to anywhere on your computer. (cd)

● Print the directory you are in. (pwd)

● Make a new directory and call it anything you want. (mkdir)

● Create a file in this folder with your name as the file name. (touch [name] or copy [name.txt]+ for windows)

● List all files in the folder you made. (ls or dir)

● Delete the file (rm or del)

● List all files in the folder you made. (ls or dir)

● Resize the Terminal and take a screenshot of the terminal such that all the above steps are visible.


## Git Sub-Project

Now let's take one of your personal projects (or just a simple hello world program) and show it off to the world.
Once you have made a GitHub account and logged in. Head to [GitHub](https://github.com/new) Set the repository name and select public. Tick the box that says Initialize this repository with a README. Now click on create repository.
Using the terminal navigate to a new folder and then use this guide to clone your new repository into the folder: [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
Using the terminal, copy your project or create a hello world program in this folder.
Add and commit the file(s) to the master branch. (See PPT on how to do this and the following steps if you forgot). Make sure to push these changes.
Make a new branch and call it ​edit_read_me​. Push these changes to github.
   
● Using your favorite text editor, edit the contents of the README file and commit these changes to the edit_read_me branch. 

● Remember to push these changes.

● Go to your GitHub repository webpage and take a screenshot of the page.
